# How to contribute?

:+1::tada: First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

You can make this website better by contributing to it. You can report mistakes
and errors, create more content, etc. Whatever is your background, there is a
way to contribute: via the GitHub website or via command-line, without writing a line of code!

## I'm new to GitHub - I'm afraid I'm going to mess things up! 
The admins of this project are pretty new to GitHub too! Here are some resources that helped us get our heads around the project:
- [A primer on GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
- [Editing files in your GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository)
- [A 10-min guide to getting started on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

And, we will work with you to address your issues and/or assess your change proposal, and help you become a member of our community.

## How can I report mistakes or errors?

The easiest way to start contributing is to [file an issue](https://github.com/osc-delft/osc-delft.github.io/issues/new) to tell us about a problem such as a typo, spelling mistake, or a factual error. 

## How can I get started with contributing?

This repository stores the sources for the website.
You can help us improve it and get acknowledged for your contributions.

Here are a few ways you can get started with contributing to this program.

1. Help us address one of the [issues currently open in our repository](https://github.com/osc-delft/osc-delft.github.io/issues).
   - Issues labelled "Good first issues" are good starting points!
2. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/osc-delft/osc-delft.github.io/issues/new) to suggest changes/improvements on our website/program.
3. Send a pull request to correct typo, or fill any gap that you see on our website.
4. Contribute a blog post that could be of interest to our community members, e.g. about your experience in the OSC Delft community, or open science. See [Stories](https://osc-delft.github.io/posts).

Do you have other ideas for contributions? Contact the community coordinator.

## How can I contribute in "advanced" mode?

Most of the content is written in
[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
with some metadata (a.k.a. front-matter) found in YAML files. Everything is
stored on this GitHub repository.

To manage changes, we use
[GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) based on Pull
Requests:

1. [Create a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of this
   repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork of this repository to create a local copy on your computer
3. Create a new branch in your local copy for each significant change
4. Commit the changes in that branch
5. Push that branch to your fork on GitHub
6. Submit a pull request from that branch to the master repository
7. If you receive feedback, make changes in your local clone and push them to
   your branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically
8. Pull requests will be merged by the training team members after at least one
   other person has reviewed the Pull request and approved it.

## What can I do to help the project?

In [issues](https://github.com/osc-delft/osc-delft.github.io/issues), you will find lists of issues to fix and features to implement. Feel
free to work on them!
