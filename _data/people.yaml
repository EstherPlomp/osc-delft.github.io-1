  motivation: In applied sciences like engineering it is becoming increasingly essential to rely on large datasets to translate fundamental knowledge into models that can eventually be utilized by industry to drive innovation. I firmly believe that the availability of accessible data along with open-source software will play a major role to close the gap between academic research and actual industry practices. My involvement in the Data Champions initiative is aimed at bringing and sharing the perspective of a researcher deeply involved in the development and deployment of open-software to enable disruptive innovations in the propulsion and power sector.

  expertise: Airborne Wind Energy
  motivation: 'I have worked for many years in the field of computational fluid dynamics, where good code and data management is crucial, and where sharing of data (for example, for benchmarking different solvers) has a long tradition. In my view, data sharing is an important extension of the concept of scientific peer review, enabling peers to retrace analyses and build on them. Without having access to the original data and source code this is generally very difficult or not possible at all. In my recent work on airborne wind energy, an emerging renewable energy technology, I have also learned that the quality of the data has a large impact on its reusability. We scientists tend to focus on the things that are of highest interest at the moment when we conduct an experiment or a computational simulation. We often neglect to record or store data that is not of immediate interest but that can potentially become interesting or very important later. I have realized this, for example, when working on a project supported by the Data Refinement Fund of the 4TU Centre for Research Data. In this project we assembled the data recordings and associated photo and video footage of five years of flight testing with our pioneering 20 Kilowatt kite power system, with the objective of making this data available to the broader research community. While it was relatively straightforward to compile the original data recordings, it was a painstaking detective work and not always possible to retrace and properly identify data that was not recorded but only written down in log files, or documented by the photo and video footage. However, it was important for anyone who wants to reuse the data. A good data management strategy would have helped address these issues. But luckily we have learned from these experiences.

Proactive sharing of high quality research data is an important ingredient of an efficient networked R&D road map. Especially for emerging technologies a good management & sharing strategy can really make a difference and contribute to a rapid advancement of the research agenda. For example, data sharing can enable researchers of different research teams to cross-validate their modeling frameworks and thus more rapidly improve the quality of the models. I am convinced that industry will ultimately benefit from such high quality modeling tools. From 2015 until 2018 I have coordinated the EU Horizon 2020 doctoral training network AWESCO, with a total of 16 PhD researchers at 12 European partner institutions, and as part of this project we had to develop, step-by-step a data management and sharing strategy. Since the project included not only academic partners but also industry, the sharing aspect especially was not an easy task. But we managed and successfully concluded the project with several collaborative research streams that produced and still continue to produce important results for the commercial development teams. As a data champion I would like to share my experiences with my fellow researchers.'
