- title: "Data, Society, and Open Science III: challenges for data management and data-based research"
  date_time: March 30, 2021, 10:45-16:30 CEST
  location: Online through Zoom
  content: |
    The Making Dark Data FAIR project aims to provide an analysis of why data goes “dark” – becomes non-reusable -- in the first place, to develop concrete strategies for how we might best enact the FAIR principles in an effort to reduce dark data, and finally to interrogate the FAIR principles themselves, in an effort to ensure they’re fulfilling the role intended for them (i.e., reducing dark data).

    This final roundtable discussion features talks exploring bias in AI, ethics, automated metadata extraction, and more!

        Beginning 2021, funders who support [Plan S](https://www.openaccess.nl/nl/in-nederland/plan-s) worldwide, including NWO, the European Commission and ERC, will adopt new open access publishing mandates for their grantees. At these AMA sessions, Just de Leeuwe (Publishing advisor, TU Delft library) will explain how this may impact researchers' publishing strategy and answer your questions regarding Plan S.

        These sessions have now been postponed to Fall/Winter 2021. If you have questions regarding Plan S, please contact the library at library [at] tudelft [nl] - we're more than happy to hear from you!
