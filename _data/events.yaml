- title: "Data, Society, and Open Science III: challenges for data management and data-based research"
  date_time: March 30, 2021, 09:00-17:00 CEST
  location: Online through Zoom
  content: |
    The Making Dark Data FAIR project aims to provide an analysis of why data goes “dark” – becomes non-reusable -- in the first place, to develop concrete strategies for how we might best enact the FAIR principles in an effort to reduce dark data, and finally to interrogate the FAIR principles themselves, in an effort to ensure they’re fulfilling the role intended for them (i.e., reducing dark data).

    We encourage submissions from as broad a range of topics as possible. Suitable areas of focus include (but are not limited to): philosophy of technology, philosophy of data, ethics of technology, ethics and science, data management, and library studies.

    We ask that you submit a 500-word abstract to <makingdarkdatafair@gmail.com> by 2nd of March  2021. Please include your name, contact information, and institutional affiliation in the body of the email.
    Accepted speakers should prepare a 20-minute talk, which will be followed by a 10-minute Q&A.
