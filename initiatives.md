**Open Science Community Delft initiatives are:**
- Designed by and for community members, with the goal to bring together community members with similar interest or goals to dive deeper/learn more about a certain are of open science
- Open to participation from all OSC Delft members

**All OSC Delft members can propose or start a new initiative.** Likewise, existing TU Delft communities can become an initiative of Open Science Community Delft. The advantages of being an OSC Delft initiative are:
- Having a big, diverse network of like-minded researchers to reach out to, encouraging otherwise unlikely collaborations
- Access to an online infrastructure to build upon - you don't need to build a website or social media account from scratch to start
- Benefit from the collective existing knowledge of the community members and community managers
- Assistance with event organisation and community management, e.g. running mailing lists

If you would like to start a new initiative or bring your community into OSC Delft, please use our [idea sandbox](https://github.com/osc-delft/ideas-and-plans) to propose and discuss the idea, or [email our community coordinator](mailto:f.tsang@tudelft.nl)
