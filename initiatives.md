**Open Science Community Delft initiatives are:**
- Designed by and for community members, with the goal to bring together community members with similar interest or goals to dive deeper/learn more about a certain are of open science
- Open to participation from all OSC Delft members

**All OSC Delft members can propose or start a new initiative.** Likewise, existing TU Delft communities can become an initiative of Open Science Community Delft. The advantages of being an OSC Delft initiative are:
- Having a big, diverse network of like-minded people to reach out to, encouraging otherwise unlikely collaborations
- Access to an online infrastructure to build upon - you don't need to build a website or social media account from scratch to start
- Benefit from the collective existing knowledge of the community members and community managers
- Assistance with event organisation and community management, e.g. running mailing lists

If you would like to start a new initiative or bring your community into OSC Delft, please use our [idea sandbox](https://github.com/osc-delft/ideas-and-plans) to propose and discuss the idea, or [email our community coordinator](mailto:f.tsang@tudelft.nl)

# Open Hardware

**Delft Open Hardware** is a bottom-up community of students, researchers, university staff and alumni at TU Delft, started in September 2019. We believe that open source software and hardware are game changers in education, research and sustainability. This is why we work on open source hardware projects and run events where we share our expertise and passion with others.

## What is open source hardware?
Open (source) hardware means releasing publicly the source of how hardware is designed so that anyone can study, improve and distribute the technology. By doing so, everyone: engineers, developers, end-users and other stakeholders, are free to improve and decide how the projects evolve on the basis of innovative ideas,
excellent work and, intensive peer review for and quality assurance.

## What does Delft Open Hardware members do?
- Design and develop open hardware projects together, through sharing our ideas in meetups and our Telegram group.
- Organise training and events to raise awareness around open hardware
- (coming soon!) Mentor and supervisor open hardware bachelor & master theses projects and internships
- (Coming soon!) Manage a makers space
